      <h2>About Alisa</h2>
      <p>
        Alisa A. Padon, PhD, is the research director for the Prevention Policy
        Group (PPG) at the Public Health Institute (PHI). She has a broad
        background in behavioral science research methods, and her research
        focus has centered on commercial determinants of health outcomes, health
        policy development, and evaluation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her work at PHI has examined the impacts of cannabis policy
        implementation on public health to develop actionable policy
        recommendations. Dr. Padon has led the development and annual collection
        of several cannabis-related regulatory and retail datasets, including:
        (1) the <strong>California Local Cannabis Laws Database (CLCLD)</strong>
        covering 539 city and county jurisdictions with 158 variables spanning
        retail practices, equity provisions, product and advertising
        restrictions, smokefree air policies, and more; and (2) the
        <strong>Dispensaries Database</strong>, which merges California
        Department of Cannabis Control license data with Weedmaps listings to
        capture retailer hours, discounts, and products. These datasets have
        been paired with outcomes data such as youth cannabis use, prenatal
        cannabis use, and point‑of‑sale metrics to test the effects of specific
        regulatory and retail characteristics on health.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Padon also has specific expertise in youth‑appealing marketing and
        promotions of cannabis, alcohol, and tobacco products. She developed the
        <em>Content Appealing to Youth (CAY) index</em>, a marketing measurement
        tool that examines psychosocial and neurocognitive appeals through the
        lens of youths’ vulnerabilities during their unique developmental stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Padon holds a doctorate in public health from the Johns Hopkins
        Bloomberg School of Public Health. She completed a master’s in bioethics
        and postdoctoral work at the University of Pennsylvania. She also spent
        several years as a senior Institutional Review Board (IRB) administrator
        at the University of Pennsylvania and has been a member of the PHI IRB
        since 2017.
